how to handle if you have error "parsing url undefined" when run db migration

- install pg globally (npm/yarn)
- export database in terminal : example
- on db config.js
    - set use_env_variable:
        example: "use_env_variable: process.env.DEV_DATABASE_URL,"
- try to db migrate again

note for join column:
- make sure alias name is the same between on the model, include/join, and attributes name of a schema
    example: 
    - you can check for alias "restaurantImages" Restaurant model associate and recipelist resolver when include
    - and you can check attributes name in Restaurant schema for  "restaurantImages"
